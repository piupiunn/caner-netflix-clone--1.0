Description;

 I got the posters, categories, release dates and names from the "themoviedb" api. The API was giving the release date as "yyyy-mm-dd". To show which movie was released last, I took this data, removed the line between them and turned it into a number. and for example I got the number 20220202 from "2022-02-02". Then, if the number obtained is greater than the number I entered today, I showed the text "New". In the video introduction part, I used "Movie Trailer" using Youtube API in the background. In this way, I was able to search for a trailer on youtube with the movie name information I got from "Themoviedb" and show it as a video above.
